    "Fast-forward a little over 10 years and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)\">Steam Store</a> is huge, ubiquitous as the home of PC gaming and distribution. Whilst physical copies still just about feel at home on consoles, the PC market has [long since moved digital](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/analyst-says-digital-sales-made-up-92-percent-of-pc-game-market-in-2013/). In case you are not familiar, Steam is a digital store for purchasing, downloading and playing video games. It hosts a variety of community features, allows pushing game updates to users automatically, and gathers news stories relevant to each title. It's a bit like [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com) or [Apple's App Store](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/app-store/) for phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of Steam's success as a platform is due to its use of frequent sales, convenience as a unified digital game library, and the aforementioned shift to digital over physical. Whilst other platforms are emerging and gaining traction, there is likely no better resource for examining gaming over the last decade. With that in mind, if we can construct a dataset from Steam's data, we will have access to a wealth of information of more than [ 30,000 games](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) released since 2003, when Steam first launched."

    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for this project is to download, process and analyse a data set of Steam apps (games) from the Steam store, and gain insights into what makes a game more successful in terms of sales, play-time and ratings. We will imagine that we have been approached by a company hoping to develop and release a new title, using the findings we provide them to inform decisions about how best to manage their budget and hopefully increase the success of their next release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step will be tackling data collection - the actual retrieval of data from Steam's servers and databases. In the future we'll look at cleaning the data, transforming it into a more useful state, then on to data exploration and analysis. Finally we'll summarise our findings in a non-technical report which would be sent to the fictional company in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the data collection and cleaning stages, we'd like to end up with a table or database like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "name | id | information | owners | price | rating\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "awesome game | 100 | genres, descriptors, variables | 100,000 | 9.99 .- | 9/10\n",
    "generic shooter 4 | 200 | just a regular shooter, teabag option available | 50,000 | 39.99 .- | 6/10\n",
    "... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then interrogate the data, and investigate whether particular attributes tend to result in more successful games. Metrics like ownership and ratings should help define the success of a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to get this information. Obviously we could search the web (and especially [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)) for existing datasets, however to avoid letting someone else get away with all that hard work (and mainly for the purposes of learning) we'll be acquiring all the data ourselves from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when generating data the best place to start is to check for APIs. Fortunately Valve (the company behind Steam) make one available at https://partner.steamgames.com/. An [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) such as this allows anyone to interface with data on a website in a controlled way, usually providing a host of useful features to the end-user. Typically an API is a great way for developers to allow access to databases and information on a server. Unfortunately this documentation doesn't include all access points, but others have documented this for us. [This](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI) documentation of the StorefrontAPI will be particularly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be able to get good information about the details of each game from the Steam API, however we're still missing information about popularity and sales. Luckily we can easily get this data from another website, SteamSpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/about) is a Steam stats-gathering service and crucially has data easily available through its own API (documentation [here](https://steamspy.com/api.php)). It provides a number of useful metrics including an estimation for total owners of each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be retrieving data from both APIs and combining them to form our dataset. For the purposes of this project, we'll be performing as little data cleaning as possible at this stage, providing 'dirty' data for data cleaning, the next step in this project.\n",
    "\n",

We'll be using [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) to handle interacting with the APIs, then the popular [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html) libraries for handling the downloaded data."

It's possible to generate one from the Steam API, however this has over 70,000 entries, many of which are demos and videos with no way to tell them apart. Instead, SteamSpy provides an 'all' request, supplying some information about the apps they track. It doesn't supply all information about each app, so we still need to request this information individually, but it provides a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because many of the return fields are strings containing commas and other punctuation, it is easiest to read the response into a pandas dataframe, and export the required appid and name fields to a csv. We could keep only the appid column as a list or pandas series, but it may be useful to keep the app name at this stage."

    "Next we run our functions to set up the files, and make a call to `process_batches` to begin the process. Some additional parameters have been added for demonstration, to constrain the download to just a few rows and smaller batches. Removing these would allow the entire download process to be repeated."

    "We now have two tables of data with a variety of information about apps on the Steam store. From the Steam data it looks like there are some useful columns like `required_age`, `developers` and `genres` which we can eventually turn into features for analysis, and a `price_overview` column which may inform the success and sales of each game. The `owners` column of the SteamSpy data could be useful, however the [margin of error](https://steamspy.com/about) means data may not be accurate enough for meaningful analysis, we'll have to see what we can manage after cleaning. Instead we may have to use the `positive` and `negative` ratings or average play-time to create our metrics. There is also a `tags` column which appears to crossover with the `categories` and `genres` columns in the Steam data. We may wish to merge these, or keep one over the other.\n",
